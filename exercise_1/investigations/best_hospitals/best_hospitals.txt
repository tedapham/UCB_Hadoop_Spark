Data are used from hospitals.csv, effective_care.csv, and readmissions.csv
The hospital_rank, effective_care_rank, and readmissions_rank were
calculated respectively.


First, the general hospital_general_rank is computed by assigning scores to
the national comparison parameters: 2 for above average, 1 same, 0 not available, -1 for below.

	These are done for mortality, safety_of_care, readmission, patient experience, effective_of_care,
	timeliness, and efficient use of medical imaging.

	The hospital_overall_rating score is coverted to float and zeros are assigned for
	not available.

	The hospital general score is computed 
	by assing 70% value to rating and 30% to the sum of national comparison
	higher is better. Then the hospital is ranked with this score and hospital_general_rank
	is assigned.



The 2nd step is to get the effective_care_rank for each provider
For this metric, the focus is on the measure ID where lower score means better
because these are the majority the parameters from effective_care.

	For example:
		ED_1b median time from ED to ED Deparutre for Addmited patients
		ED_2b admit decision time
		OP_20 median time from ed to provider contact for ED patients
		OP_22 left before being seen.

	Ranking for each chosen measure_id is computed using rank()
	Then, the sum(rank) is computed for each provider.
	The average rank is then evalued by dividng the sum(rank) by total measure_id
	and from that, the effective_care_rank is computed.



The 3rd step is to get readmission specific rank
Similar to the effective care, for the readmission score lower is better. 
All measure_ids are included and the readmssion_rank is computed in a similar fashion 
to the effective_care_rank.


Finally, the total rank_score is (general_rank + effective_rank*2 + readmission_rank*2)/3.
More weight is given to the hospital_general_rank (derived from hospitals.csv data).
This approach is appropriate because it takes into account each hospital ranking from
3 different methodologies: general info, readmission, and effective_care.

Note that the lower the rank_score the better the hospital.
