Join transform_surveys and best_hospitals so that we can compute the correlation coefficient 
between hospital ranking (rating) score and patients survey responses regarding nurse, doctor etc.

Since I used the ranking score which implicates lower is better, I multiplied the computed correlation by -1
to account for this method to indicate positive correlation. 

The results are:


Correlation coeff between hospital rating and nurse rating = 0.48339620530809635 
Correlation between hospital rating and doctor rating = 0.4947905079954879
Correlation coeff between hospital rating and  staff rating = 0.5711558863794441	
Correlation coeff between hospital rating and pain management=0.4798737218622439	
Correlation coeff between hospital rating and quality communication =0.4588237402741231
Correlation coeff between hospital rating and environment =0.5445447985394134	
Correlation coeff between hospital rating and quality discharge =0.3491216066212744	
Correlation coeff between hospital rating and overall hospital performance=0.4997264434722071

Hospital rating (by previously described method) correlate well with patients survey rating.
In particular, staff rating and hospital rating is the highest, followed by environment rating, 
patient rating of the hospital,doctor rating, nurse rating, pain management, pain medicine communication, 
and quality discharge.

It seems the method used to access the quality of care is well correlated with patients' assessment.
From the correlation, it would be advised for hospitals to invest resource to staff then hospital enviroment.
